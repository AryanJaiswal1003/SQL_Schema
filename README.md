# SQL Projects – My Data Science Journey Begins

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository!  
This marks the **first official step** in my journey towards becoming a **Data Scientist** 
Currently, I'm learning SQL through the **BossCoder Academy** and building mini-projects to practice and solidify my concepts.

## About This Repository

This repo is a collection of hands-on SQL projects that I created while learning:

- Basic to Advanced SQL concepts  
- Real-world query writing  
- Data filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries  
- Data transformation & analysis  
- Understanding databases and schemas  

## Learning Highlights & Reflections

* Some takeaways from my SQL learning journey so far:

- Understood the **importance of clean and readable queries**
- Learned how to write **efficient JOINs** (inner, left, self)
- Built my foundation with **real database structures**
- Faced bugs, failed queries, and weird NULLs... but learned from each!
- Developed confidence to read and write complex business queries

> "Every query written is a brick laid on the path to becoming a data scientist."


## Why This Matters

SQL is **not just a query language** – it's a powerful tool to:

- Uncover hidden insights 🕵️‍♂️  
- Understand user behavior 🔍  
- Help businesses grow using data 📊  
- Form the foundation for tools like Python, Pandas, PowerBI, Tableau & more 🔧  

This repository is my **SQL diary**, documenting my growth from a beginner to someone who can **ask questions to data** and get answers! 💬➡️📉


## What's Next?

After mastering SQL, I plan to move toward:

- 🐍 **Python for Data Analysis**  
- 📉 **Statistics & Probability**  
- 🔮 **Machine Learning (ML)**  
- 📊 **Visualization Tools** (PowerBI, Tableau)  
- 🤖 **AI & Deep Learning** (eventually!)
