# 📊 SQL Projects – My Data Science Journey Begins 🚀

Welcome to my SQL Projects repository!  
This marks the **first official step** in my journey towards becoming a **Data Scientist** 👨‍💻✨ 
Currently, I'm learning SQL through the **BossCoder Academy** 🧠 and building mini-projects to practice and solidify my concepts.

## 🏁 About This Repository

This repo is a collection of hands-on SQL projects that I created while learning:

- 📚 Basic to Advanced SQL concepts  
- 🛠 Real-world query writing  
- 🔍 Data filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries  
- 📊 Data transformation & analysis  
- 🧱 Understanding databases and schemas  

## 🧠 Learning Highlights & Reflections

✨ Some takeaways from my SQL learning journey so far:

- 👓 Understood the **importance of clean and readable queries**
- 🔄 Learned how to write **efficient JOINs** (inner, left, self)
- 🧱 Built my foundation with **real database structures**
- 💥 Faced bugs, failed queries, and weird NULLs... but learned from each! 💪
- 😎 Developed confidence to read and write complex business queries

> "Every query written is a brick laid on the path to becoming a data scientist." 🧱📈


## 🔍 Why This Matters

SQL is **not just a query language** – it's a powerful tool to:

- Uncover hidden insights 🕵️‍♂️  
- Understand user behavior 🔍  
- Help businesses grow using data 📊  
- Form the foundation for tools like Python, Pandas, PowerBI, Tableau & more 🔧  

This repository is my **SQL diary**, documenting my growth from a beginner to someone who can **ask questions to data** and get answers! 💬➡️📉


## 📆 What's Next?

After mastering SQL, I plan to move toward:

- 🐍 **Python for Data Analysis**  
- 📉 **Statistics & Probability**  
- 🔮 **Machine Learning (ML)**  
- 📊 **Visualization Tools** (PowerBI, Tableau)  
- 🤖 **AI & Deep Learning** (eventually!)
